			   		<h2 class="text-success text-center">ABOUT US</h2>
				   		<p>The DePaul Hope Social Center is a registered Non-profit Organization both in the United States of America, on 13 November, 2013 and Nigeria, in May, 2015. It was established by Rev. Fr. Jacob Ugwoke CM, at DePaul Kenmore Residence Chicago, United States of America and owned by the Vincentian Province of Nigeria. The organization’s programmes focus on widow empowerment through counseling, microloans, legal referral, computer skill acquisition, seminars and widows’ forum, and education of the children of widows. Our empowerment programmes currently provide widows with vocational training, while our educational programs offer scholarships and educational support to the children of widows all across Nigeria. The organization also supports widows, who have lost their husbands to HIV/AIDS and provides women, in general, with free medical care and aid.</p>
			   			<h4 class="text-success text-center" id="founders">HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION</h4>
			   			<p>
			   				In 2014, after the completion of his masters in Social Work at DePaul University, Chicago, Rev. Fr. Jacob Ugwoke, CM started thinking of what he would do at home in Nigeria as a Vincentian, in order to impact on the life of his people back at home. He applied for a one year internship to enable him conduct a research on this. He did his training with The Coalition of African, Arab, Asian, European and Latino Immigrants of Illinois (CAAAELII) Organization and was mentored by Dale Asis, the Director of CAAELI Organization and with his assistance, organized a fundraiser at Vincentian Kenmore House Chicago. Some of those who attended the fundraiser were, Rev. Fr. Fidelis Idagbo (representing the provincial superior of the Vincentians in Nigeria), Dale Asis, the Director of CAAELI Organization, Rotary Club of Chicago Far North, the president of DePaul University Chicago, members of WAWA Association Chicago branch and their cultural dancers. With the money realized from the launching, Fr. Jacob came back home and started the organization in Nigeria in 2015. On a Sunday, in March, 2015 an announcement was made at Our Lady of Lourdes Parish about the commencement of the new organization called DePaul Hope Social Center; five widows showed up and with this number the organization took off its operation with only Fr. Jacob piloting its affair and Mrs. Sussan Ozioko, later, joining the organization in 2015, with Knight Sylvester Ike as its adviser and Mrs. Chiawa Uchenna joining the staff in February, 2016. Today DePaul Hope Social Centre has 360 clients.
